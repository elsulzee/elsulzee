## 👋 Hi, I’m @elsulzee

👨🏾‍💻 I’m passionate about **software development** — both **web** and **mobile** apps  
🛠️ I’m currently working with **PHP (API + Backend) json**, **Dart**, and **Flutter**  
🌱 Learning to become a full-stack developer, integrating **backend systems with frontend UIs**  
💼 Recently worked on projects like:  
- E-commerce backend with PHP and JSON API  
- Authentication systems (register/login/reset)  
- UI design for banking & religious apps using Flutter  

🤝 I’m open to beginner-friendly collaborations and growth-based internships
